You will need to download Stackoverflowâ€™s 2017 and 2018 Annual Developer Survey and put in specific folders. You can find the data to download [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). </br>


## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project.I was interested in using Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to better understand:</br>
1. What are the most used programming languages in India? </br>
2. What are the most wanted programming languages in India? </br>
3. How does programming languages used at work relates with programming languages people want to learn? </br>
